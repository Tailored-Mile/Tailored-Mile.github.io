Hey there! My name is Miles and this is a space meant to document my progress learning how to code. I'll update this each time a new project is added along with some learning outcomes from the project. My eventual goal is to tie my learning more with biology and chemistry as I'm interested in bioinformatics and data analytics. However, for now I'm starting with the foundational information and working up from there. 

Project 1: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!
